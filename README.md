# blurStrangersAI
blurs people who are not intended to be shown on camera. Specifically, the AI is trained to only recognize obama and blurs anyone else who is not obama. 
the potential use case for something like this is for youtubers or people doing livestreaming to blur random people out in case they dont want to be seen on camera.
FYI, this code only works on pictures but it can be modified for video
